## Project Description

In this project, you will delve into the world of Makefiles, a vital tool for automating the compilation and linking of C code. You'll explore how to create Makefiles, define rules, work with variables, and manage dependencies efficiently.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concepts of make and Makefiles.
- Understand when, why, and how to use Makefiles.
- Define rules and know how to set and use them.
- Differentiate between explicit and implicit rules.
- Identify common and useful rules in Makefiles.
- Work with variables in Makefiles.

## Getting Started

To begin working on this project, please ensure that you have the following environment set up:

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- GCC version: 9.3.0
- GNU Make version: 4.2.1

## Tasks

### Task 0: 0-Makefile
- Start by creating your first Makefile with the following requirements:
  - Name of the executable: school
  - Rule: all (builds your executable)
  - Variables: None

### Task 1: 1-Makefile
- Enhance your Makefile by adding variables CC and SRC.
- Requirements include specifying the compiler to be used (CC) and the source files (SRC).

### Task 2: 2-Makefile
- Continue improving your Makefile with more variables: CC, SRC, OBJ, and NAME.
- The all rule should recompile only the updated source files.

### Task 3: 3-Makefile
- Extend your Makefile to include rules for cleaning (clean, oclean, fclean) and recompilation (re).
- You'll also need additional variables: RM for file removal and CFLAGS for compiler flags.

### Task 4: 4-Makefile
- Create a complete Makefile with extra compiler flags (CFLAGS) and rules for managing your project.

### Task 5: 5-Island Perimeter
- In this task, you'll create a Python function to calculate the perimeter of an island.
- The function should meet specific requirements regarding input and output.

### Task 6: 100-Makefile
- Finally, create an advanced Makefile that includes additional constraints and rules.
- Ensure that your Makefile complies with the given constraints and requirements.
